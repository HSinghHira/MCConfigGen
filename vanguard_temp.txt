# Minecraft Rank System Builder - Documentation

## 1. Purpose

This web application is a **visual configuration tool for creating Minecraft server rank systems**. It allows server administrators to:

- Design custom rank progression systems with icons, lore, and requirements
- Generate ready-to-use configuration files (ranks.yml and installranks.sk)
- Configure LuckPerms permissions integration
- Set up automated commands that execute when players obtain ranks
- Export/import configurations for backup and sharing

The tool outputs files compatible with popular Minecraft server plugins for rank management.
